## Textbooks
We will assign readings from the following texts.

* [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al.
* [Machine Learning Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Murphy
**Other Supplemental Texts**
* [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html), by Tom Mitchell. *Great introduction to machine learning*

**Web Resources**
* Theoretical Computer Science Cheat Sheet Definitions Series  has some useful formulae for this class, but also for others, including algorithms.
