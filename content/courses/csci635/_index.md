## Course Outcomes

Students will be able to:

* Describe the types of problems that machine learning techniques are used to solve, and which machine learning algorithms are appropriate for solving each type of problem.
* Describe, compare, and contrast different machine learning algorithms.
* Implement machine learning algorithms using labeled data.
* Work as a team to implement solutions to complex, real world machine learning problems.
* Describe evaluation techniques for assessing and comparing machine learning techniques.

## Digesting the Course

Due to COVID-19, there will be no in-person classes this summer and the medium of instruction would be virtual.
