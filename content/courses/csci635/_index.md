## Course Outcomes

Students will be able to:

* Describe the types of problems that machine learning techniques are used to solve, and which machine learning algorithms are appropriate for solving each type of problem.
* Describe, compare, and contrast different machine learning algorithms.
* Implement machine learning algorithms using labeled data.
* Work as a team to implement solutions to complex, real world machine learning problems.
* Describe evaluation techniques for assessing and comparing machine learning techniques.

## Digesting the Course

Due to COVID-19, there will be no in-person classes this summer and the medium of instruction would be virtual. I will release a media package to the Contents section every Sunday evening (by 11:59 EST) of the week of each given topic. They will resemble slides, but may contain videos, notes, articles, etc..

We will organize weekly discussions based on your responses to the [onboarding survey Google Form](https://forms.gle/PHJL8kipx5v9vkAP8).

## Mental Health and Well-Being
Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to myself, your other instructors, and your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.
