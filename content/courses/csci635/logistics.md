## Experiments for Homeworks & Projects

I expect you to be familiar with writing code in `Python 3`, and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). I expect you to be familiar with running a notebook and answering the questions related to a homework using it. You do not need to own a machine with a GPU, but it does make things faster (TBA: Access to a CS Server with a GPU which you can use for completing Homeworks and Projects). 

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) - Google provides free tools to learn machine learning and Colab is its own Jupyter notebook server. Consider it Google Docs, but for ML. Best of all, you do not need to configure anything, it is ready to run out of the box.

[Google Cloud](https://gcpsignup.page.link/RGyv) - Another great solution from Google for their Cloud computing, which lets you use their GPU VMs for a 1 year without any cost.

## Project Reports

For project submissions, the code should be accompanied by a properly formatted report using LaTex. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) for your collaboration between team members. 

**The submission should be using the [ArXiv Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/style-and-template-for-preprints-arxiv-bio-arxiv/fxsnsrzpnvwc).**
