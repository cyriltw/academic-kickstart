### Rescheduling an Exam

Exams can not be made up except for real emergencies in which case proper documentation (like a doctor's note) will be required. If at all possible, you should contact me prior to the exam. Oversleeping, cars that don't start etc. do not constitute a valid excuse.  
  
Please refer to the [Final Examination Policies](http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/Manual/sectionD/D11.html) for related questions.

### Course Withdrawal

During the add/drop period, you may drop this course and it will disappear from your transcript. After that time, you can only withdraw from the course; the course will appear on your transcript with a grade of `W`. See the institute's [calendar](http://www.rit.edu/calendar) regarding the add/drop period and latest withdrawal date.

### Disability Services

RIT is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. If you would like to request accommodations such as special seating or testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. It is located in the Student Alumni Union, Room 1150; the web site is [www.rit.edu/dso](http://www.rit.edu/dso). After you receive accommodation approval, it is imperative that you see me during office hours so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.

### Academic Integrity

The [DCS Policy on Academic Honesty](http://www.cs.rit.edu/csdocs/AcademicHonestyPolicy.pdf) will be enforced.  
You should only submit work that is completely your own. Failure to do so counts as academic dishonesty and so does being the source of such work. Submitting work that is in large part not completely your own work is a flagrant violation of basic ethical behavior and will be punished according to department policy.
