abstract: "Sri Lankan English (SLE) has unique phonological, morphological, lexical\
  \ and syntactic features which have gradually developed since the introduction of\
  \ English to Sri Lanka. Vocabulary is one of the first features to develop in SLE.\
  \ Although the SLE vocabulary has been studied and recorded, its generational difference\
  \ has not been examined. The objective of the study was to investigate if the ‘generational\
  \ change' observable in the SLE vocabulary could be considered an evolution. This\
  \ was done through a qualitative, comparative analysis of the vocabulary used in\
  \ the decades 1955 – 1965 and 2005 – 2015. The theoretical base of the research\
  \ was defined using two theories of language evolution: the apparent-time hypothesis\
  \ and age-gradedness. The primary data was taken from the Ceylon Observer of the\
  \ decade 1955 – 1965 and the Sunday Observer of the decade 2005 - 2015. The words\
  \ were used in a questionnaire survey of 60 participants of which 30 were of the\
  \ age 15 – 25 years and 30 were of the age 65- 75 years. The results of the survey\
  \ were then analyzed in detail through 10 interviews. The surveys and the interviews\
  \ were conducted to prove / disprove the age-gradedness of the SLE vocabulary and\
  \ to prove / disprove the apparent-time hypothesis in relation to the SLE vocabulary.\
  \ Most of the vocabulary used disproved age-gradedness. The usages of these terms\
  \ were found to be generation specific, which supported that the SLE vocabulary\
  \ is not age-graded. The interviews supported the apparent-time hypotheses as the\
  \ older generation showed that their vocabulary has not changed significantly over\
  \ the years. From these observations, it could be concluded that within the scope\
  \ of the research, the generational difference observable in the SLE vocabulary\
  \ over 60 years could be termed an evolution."
