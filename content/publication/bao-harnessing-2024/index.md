abstract: "This paper introduces Fortune Analytics Language Model (FALM). FALM empowers
  users with direct access to comprehensive business analysis, including market trends,
  company performance metrics, and expert insights. Unlike generic LLMs, FALM leverages
  a curated knowledge base built from professional journalism, enabling it to deliver
  precise and in-depth answers to intricate business questions. Users can further
  leverage natural language queries to directly visualize financial data, generating
  insightful charts and graphs to understand trends across diverse business sectors
  clearly. FALM fosters user trust and ensures output accuracy through three novel
  methods: 1) Time-aware reasoning guarantees accurate event registration and prioritizes
  recent updates. 2) Thematic trend analysis explicitly examines topic evolution over
  time, providing insights into emerging business landscapes. 3) Content referencing
  and task decomposition enhance answer fidelity and data visualization accuracy.
  We conduct both automated and human evaluations, demonstrating FALM's significant
  performance improvements over baseline methods while prioritizing responsible AI
  practices. These benchmarks establish FALM as a cutting-edge LLM in the business
  and media domains, with exceptional accuracy and trustworthiness."
