abstract: Trains are a popular mode of public transport used by daily commuters in
  Sri Lanka. However, the process of ticketing in the trains causes a number of inconveniences.
  At present, some countries use a debit card designed exclusively for train travel
  as a means of reducing the hassle. However, the paper based ticket is still commonly
  used for train travel in many countries, including Sri Lanka. The aims of this research
  are to develop an automated ticketing system that would replace the existing train
  ticketing system while providing an online seat reservation system. Due to the increase
  in efficiency of the proposed system, it would be beneficial to the commuters as
  well as the staff of the Department of Railways. From the beginning of 2016, the
  Electronic National Identity Card (henceforth referred to as e-NIC) was proposed
  to be used in Sri Lanka. The research presents an alternative system of ticketing
  where the e-NIC is mainly used to replace the traditional train ticket, thereby
  increasing the efficiency of the purchase and the use of train tickets. The e-NIC
  is combined with the bank account of the commuter. The system supports four types
  of passes, the e-NIC, prepaid pass, booked ticket and kids pass. Once the commuter
  enters a station, the pass is initially validated by the platform scanner (PS),
  upon entering a certain train, the train number and station he/she enters is recorded
  by the train scanner (TS). Once he/she gets down from the destination, the TS and
  the PS validate the train details and trip cost is deducted from the account. This
  new method has many advantages over the traditional train ticketing system. These
  include reducing the time spent on ticket purchase, eliminating the need to use
  cash in the process and strengthening the security of the issue and purchase of
  the train tickets. This would also help in the prevention of ticket fraud. The program
  was white box tested. This is proposed to be used in Sri Lanka, however the method
  can be expanded to other countries. The concept system was developed using Java
  and backed up by MySQL databases.
